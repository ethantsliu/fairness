### Exploring Fairness and Explainability in Multimodal Machine Learning Models 

Exploring Fairness and Explainability in Multimodal Machine Learning Models Fusing Fitbit and Health Record Data Streams is a project focused on building predictive models using data from the All of Us Research Program (AOU), NHANES, and the MIMIC-IV clinical and waveform datasets. The goal is to improve the accuracy and fairness of machine learning models used in healthcare, particularly in predicting cardiovascular and metabolic conditions using multimodal data streams that include wearable-derived features such as PPG, SpO₂, and non-invasive blood pressure. The project addresses known biases in wearable technology, such as decreased sensor reliability in individuals with darker skin tones, while also advancing model transparency and generalizability.

In this project, we contributed by developing helper functions to extract and standardize lab and Fitbit data across datasets, performing data cleaning and merging, and fine-tuning classical ML models (like XGBoost) to predict hypertension and cardiovascular risk. We led efforts to filter out non-routinely collected features (e.g., cotinine, hs-CRP) and prioritized clinically common variables such as age, gender, BMI, waist circumference, blood pressure, cholesterol, triglycerides, and dietary intake. We also worked on preprocessing large-scale datasets, including the 2011–2024 NHANES cohorts and multiple All of Us Fitbit concept sets, organizing them into reusable CSVs for modeling.

The project integrates wearable proxy signals from MIMIC waveform data and aligns them with clinical records to simulate real-world, multimodal patient monitoring. We applied fairness auditing using AIF360 and implemented metrics such as Statistical Parity, Equal Opportunity, and Equalized Odds, with specific focus on minimizing disparities in false positive and false negative rates. To enhance explainability, we used local interpretability methods like LIME and global tools like SHAP to better understand model predictions across demographic groups.

Our modeling pipeline includes classical methods for EHR-only baselines and deep learning models (LSTM, CNN) for sequential waveform and activity data. All data pipelines are organized for scalability across use cases and include helper functions, preprocessing scripts, and fairness modules. Current work involves time-series modeling of accelerometry data, visualizing performance metrics like MAE in original units, and evaluating fairness-aware models across stratified subgroups. The final deliverable includes a three-page research report summarizing methods, results, and conclusions to be shared with collaborators and reviewed by our PI.
